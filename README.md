# FT_STR_IS_PRINTABLE 

This repository is dedicated to the `ft_str_is_printable` function, a utility designed to assess the printability of strings in C programming. It verifies that a string contains only characters that are printable according to the ASCII standard, making it a crucial tool for input validation, data processing, and ensuring text can be safely displayed.

## Description

`ft_str_is_printable` iterates through a given string, evaluating each character to determine if it falls within the range of printable ASCII characters (from 32 to 126, inclusive). The function returns `1` (true) if the string is entirely composed of printable characters, and `0` (false) if it encounters any non-printable character.
